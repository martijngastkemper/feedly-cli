# Feedly CLI

Quickly add an url with some tags to your Feedly account. You need a developer access token for this app to work. The token expires after 30 days, free acounts can't refresh the token. A new one must be requested. 

## Installation

    git clone git@github.com:martijngastkemper/feedly-cli.git

## Feature requests

Some features I would like to add.

- Add url to Read later list
- Ask for access token when it's expired
- Notify when access token is almost expired
- Notify when rate limit is almost reached
- Add unit tests
- Refresh token (only for paid accounts) 
- NPM packages
